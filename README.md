To run the the project, clone it first, then go to the project directory and run the command.

after that, to start the projec, simply run this command.

Detail about the project.

1. At max user can only add 4 command at a time otherwise it will give error.
2. To avoid error, user have to enter the exact command name and command name can only start with c,r,p or e.
3. Failing to follow the format will result in errors, and user can see them once he/she click on the draw button.
4. Below is the format for the commands
5. Circle: CX - CY - Radius | c 20 50 44
6. Rectangle: X - Y - Width - Height | r 20 50 44 55
7. Polygon: X1,Y1 - X2,Y2 - X3,Y3 | p 98,89 50,78 77,67
8. If user put the extra space at the end of the command, app will give the erroe to strictly follow the command format.
## Bonus Task
9. Ellipse: EX - EY - HRadius - VRadius | e 20 50 44 54

## Note

If any command has less parameter or more than required parameter error will pop up and tell the user, which line or command has error.
I would Attach ScreenShot too, to give the user better idea how it works.

## Correct Format
1. c 20 50 44 (line End - Press enter after every command.)
2. r 20 50 44 55
3. p 98,89 50,78 77,67
4. e 20 50 44 54
